## Description

This R package takes as impute several correlation matrices from
    gene expression datasets and returns the common estimated correlation matrix,
    the gene modules, and the best number of gene modules. The estimation of the
    common correlation matrix is done through an empirical Bayes model, as described
    in Zollinger et al. (2017) (submitted). The module construction is performed
    by hierarchical clustering. The optimal number of modules is found by using a
    modified version of the GAP statistic.

## Installation

To install this R package, use the following commands
```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("azolling/EBmodules")
library(EBmodules)
```

## Example
```{r example,eval=FALSE}
estimation <-bayesian_modules(R,select=100000)
```
where $R$ is a list of correlation matrices.
